            The development of Node.js made it necessary to have a module
            system in JavaScript that did not rely on HTML script tags. Node.js
            applications do not run in a browser so script tags are not 
            available. Node.js developed a module systems based off a standard  
            defined by a project called CommonJS. This system allows modules to 
            declare which dependencies that they require in the module itself.
            
            CommonJS modules were not designed to work in a browser. Module
            bundlers such as Browserify and Webpack were developed to allow you
            to write browser code using CommonJS modules. Module bundlers work
            by going through your code to find all your dependencies and bundles
            all the necessary code into one file. This one file is then included
            on an HTML page in a script tag.
            
            Problems still remain with using CommonJS modules in a browser.

        <ul>
            <li>Browsers do not natively support it</li>
            <li>Modules are loaded synchronously</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Around the same time, other module systems were developed such as
            Asynchronous Module Definition and Universal Module Definition.
            These systems were designed to address some of the issues with 
            using CommonJS in browsers but they had their own issues too.
