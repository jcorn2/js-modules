            ECMAScript 2015 introduced a modules standard for JavaScript that is
            to be use for browsers. Programs such as Webpack were still require
            to use this module system until browsers started supporting it. Static
            imports were only allowed at first, but dynamic import support was 
            added later as part of ECMAScript 2020.
