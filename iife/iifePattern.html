            The iife pattern was developed to avoid adding variables and functions 
            to the global namespace. An iife stands for an immediately invoked 
            function expression. By wrapping the contents of your script in an iife,
            the script's variables and functions are scoped to the function and not
            the global namespace. To make any variables or functions from your script
            accessible outside of the iife, they need to be added to an object contain
            in the global scope. This method reduces the number of variables and 
            functions added to the global scope to just one object. While this method
            is an improvement, some issues still remain.

        <ul>
            <li>A variable is still added to the global namespace</li>
            <li>Doesn't improve dependency management.</li>
            <li>Every script needs to be wrapped in an iife</li>
        </ul>
